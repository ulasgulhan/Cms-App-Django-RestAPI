# cms-app-django-fastapi

I developed an E-commerce/CMS project using the Python Django framework. Additionally, I created the same project using Django Rest API to grasp the differences between them and gain practical experience. The E-commerce site involves three user classes: customers, suppliers, and admins. Admins and suppliers have the ability to add and delete products, whereas customers do not possess these privileges.
